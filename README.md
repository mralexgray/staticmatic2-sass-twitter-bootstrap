# StaticMatic2 Bootstrap based on Twitter Bootstrap

The following is a rough bootstrap that pulls together several peoples work. None of this work was mine, so any gratitude should go to the following:

* The Twitter team [https://github.com/twitter](https://github.com/twitter) for the Twitter Bootstrap project
* John W. Long [https://github.com/jlong](https://github.com/jlong) for the excellent less2sass conversion of Twitters work
* Adam Stacoviak [https://github.com/adamstac](https://github.com/adamstac) for producing several great bootstraps
* Gilbert [https://github.com/mindeavor](https://github.com/mindeavor) for excellent work enhancing staticmatic, including seamless upload to s3
