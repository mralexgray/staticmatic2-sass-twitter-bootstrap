    %h1 Bootstrap Time!
    %p 
      The following is a rough bootstrap that pulls together some closely related ideas.
      None of these ideas were mine, and all credit should go to the following:
    
    :markdown
      * The Twitter team [https://github.com/twitter](https://github.com/twitter) for the Twitter Bootstrap project
      * John W. Long [https://github.com/jlong](https://github.com/jlong) for the excellent less2sass conversion of Twitters work
      * Adam Stacoviak [https://github.com/adamstac](https://github.com/adamstac) for producing several great bootstraps
      * Gilbert [https://github.com/mindeavor](https://github.com/mindeavor) for excellent work enhancing staticmatic, including seamless upload to s3
  
    %p 
      I'm aware that some of the CSS breaks, because the twitter bootstrap is now up to 1.30 and
      and less2sass conversions haven't quite caught up yet.
